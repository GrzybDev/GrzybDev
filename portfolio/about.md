Hi! I'm **Marek**, an *Python Backend Developer* from ***Poland***, and I've been coding since I was 12 years old.

I published my first website couple months later, and since then I've been learning new technologies and programming languages.

Here you can see some of the projects I've had the opportunity of contributing to, and some of the personal-fun-things I've been working on.

I have a strong perseverance for learning new things and taking on challenges, and I always like to put some extra time in polishing my creations, to make sure the creative vision is achieved in the best possible way.

I'm especially focused on network related programming.

Besides programming I've always been extremely curious in the technical side of games, and sometimes this curiosity has led me to projects like fan translations or more 'serious' projects like Backend Emulators.

Sometimes I also make websites, like this one. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me. ðŸ˜‰
